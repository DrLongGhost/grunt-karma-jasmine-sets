# grunt-karma-jasmine-sets

This is a sample project showing how karma-sets can be used alongside jasmine
and grunt-karma.



# Usage

npm install

Apply a fix to node_modules/karma-sets/index.js to change browser.launchId to browser.id

Run grunt karma

This will run all the tests in the set but currently does not exit cleanly
